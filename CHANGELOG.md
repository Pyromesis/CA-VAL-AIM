# Changelog

## 1.16.0 — 2026-10-20

### Added

- All 13 standard maps are selectable: Ascent, Bind, Breeze, Fracture, Haven, Icebox, Lotus, Pearl, Split, Sunset,
  Summit, Abyss and Corrode.
- Real extracted geometry, textures and collision for Ascent, Fracture, Lotus, Sunset, Pearl, Summit, Abyss and Corrode.
- Vandal and Phantom spray/recoil behaviour, including spray charts and spray transfer.
- VALORANT sensitivity and crosshair import, Sens Finder and the sensitivity coach.
- Spanish UI and localized result text.
- Full-map release packages: the installer and portable zip include the optional `maps/` geometry.

### Fixed

- Collision no longer lets the player rise or fly through ceilings, or walk through walls.
- Negative-floor and missing-floor handling no longer drops the player out of the map.
- Fall-kill safety and movement checks.

### Packaging

- `ValTrainer-1.16.0-Setup.exe` and `ValTrainer-1.16.0-Portable.zip` are self-contained and include the map assets.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` is published with the release.
- The Git repository excludes the multi-gigabyte extracted map binaries; see `README.md` and `NOTICE`.
